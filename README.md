# LSSMod

Some enhancements for the UI.

## Getting Started

Find a feature you want and click the link to install the script.

- Reorder Missions <https://github.com/abaldeweg/lssmod/raw/main/reorder-missions.user.js>
Alliance missions will get a highter priority. Infos about not having missions are hidden.
- Install Notifications <https://github.com/abaldeweg/lssmod/raw/main/notifications.user.js>
You will get a notification when you need to react on status 5 even when you are in another app - just keep the page open (supported browsers only).  
- Move alerts to the bottom <https://github.com/abaldeweg/lssmod/raw/main/alerts.user.js>
Feedback thats inserted on the top of the page (e.g. the green alerts) are now on the bottom.
- Fix the list of requested vehicles <https://github.com/abaldeweg/lssmod/raw/main/requested-vehicles.user.js>
You do not have to scroll to the top to see the requested vehicles. This script will fix the requirements on the bottom, so you can see it anytime.
